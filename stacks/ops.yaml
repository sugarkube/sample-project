# todo - document it's possible to run these stacks while overriding e.g. just the cluster
# name to deploy there. Then we could have stacks for different tasks (e.g. opsy-stuff,
# ci-cd, monitoring) and devs could just deploy them to their own cluster without
# duplicating these different stacks, one per developer).
