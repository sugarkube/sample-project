# This manifest bootstraps a k8s cluster with services that should alwasy be
# installed, regardless of whether running on a cloud provider or locally. First
# it installs tiller, then installs cert-manager then nginx ingress. Because
# kapps must be installed in exactly that order, parallelism is disabled for
# this manifest.
#
# This manifest could be a good place to put other universal, cluster-wide
# kapps, e.g. for pod security policies, RBAC, etc.

# Kapps listed under this key will be installed if they are not currently
# installed in the target cluster.
